## 📖 What is SoulX-Singer-Eval?

SoulX-Singer-Eval is a simple tool designed to help you test and compare singing voice synthesis. It lets you check the quality of computer-generated singing without needing any programming skills.

This program works as an evaluation suite for zero-shot singing voice synthesis. That means it can assess singing voices created by AI models, even ones it has not seen before. The goal is to help developers and hobbyists understand how well these voices sound.

You do not need to know anything about coding or machine learning to use it. The package includes easy ways to listen, score, and review singing samples.
